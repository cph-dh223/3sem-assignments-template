The exseresie is allready solved
the exsersise is: "Fix the below code so that the Counter classÂ´s increment method is thread safe:" and the method is allready thread safe as it uses the synchronized keyword
```JAVA
private static class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Method to increment the count, synchronized to ensure thread safety
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    // Method to retrieve the current count value
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
